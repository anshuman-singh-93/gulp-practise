                  <p>
                    "Personal Information" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you,
                    including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as
                    any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of
                    the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to
                    your Personal Information; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification
                    of individual persons. We collect Personal Information and Anonymous Data, as described
                    below.

                      to enter your SNS credentials and then be given the option to register for the

                        useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service

                        system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically
                        assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session
                        to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.

                      <li>
                        <u>Log Files.</u> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
                        automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses,
                        browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating
                        system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to
                        analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site,
                        gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor
                        our Service to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be
                        collected so that when you visit the Site or the Service again, it will
                        recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and
                        other information appropriate to your interests. Except as noted in this Privacy
                        Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal
                        Information.

                        information. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to
                        your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both
                        session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
                        Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with
                        a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information
                        is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience
                        with us to meet your special interests and needs.

                        <u>Pixel Tags.</u> •In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear
                        Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a
                        unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online
                        movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s
                        computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags
                        also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell
                        us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages
                        that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or
                        eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by
                        Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Information.

                        prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics
                        only to improve our Site and Service. Google Analytics collects only the IP
                        address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or
                        other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information
                        generated through the use of Google Analytics with your Personal Information.
                        Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to
                        identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Site, the Cookie

                      We often receive testimonials and comments from users who have had positive
                      experiences with our Service. We occasionally publish such content. When we publish

                      with the testimonial. If you make any comments on a blog or forum associated with
                      your Site, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit there can be
                      read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send
                      you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable

                      information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.
                      We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may
                      enhance the content of our Service and improve Site navigation. We reserve the right

                      Our Service may enable you to post content to SNSs. If you choose to do this, we
                      will provide information to such SNSs in accordance with your elections. You
                      acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites
                      and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of
                      the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i)
                      the availability or accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on
                      or availability of such SNSs; or (iii) your use of any such SNSs.

                    <p>
                      Certain portions of the information you provide to us may also be displayed in your
                      Profile. As an essential element of the service, most of the Personal Information
                      you explicitly provide to us when you register or update your Profile is displayed
                      on your Profile. In order for your Profile to be made public, you must go to your
                      profile settings and then to profile visibility. By default, your Profile is not for
                      public viewing. Your photos, posts, friends, and other content you post to the Site
                      are also meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Site and
                      further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.
                      Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and
                      used by others. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do
                      with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do
                      not put Personal Information in your posts. Once you have posted information
                      publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Site, you will
                      not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored
                      elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).

                      information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such
                      information. You may change your settings at any time as to who has access to your
                      information by going to your account settings and changing your publishing options.
